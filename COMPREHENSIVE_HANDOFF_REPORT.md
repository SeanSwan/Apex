## 2. COMPLETED WORK (SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS)

### PHASE A: CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFICATION & RESOLUTION ✅

#### 🚨 DISCOVERED CRITICAL SYSTEM-BREAKING BUGS:
**Bug Category: API Method Incompatibility (Severity: CRITICAL)**

- **Impact**: Would cause immediate runtime crashes when users click takeover/escalation buttons
- **Examples**: `webSocketManager.sendMessage()`, `webSocketManager.subscribeToMessage()`, `webSocketManager.getSocketId()`
- **Root Cause**: Components were written using generic WebSocket patterns instead of the specific Voice AI methods

**Bug Category: Event Handling Incompatibility (Severity: CRITICAL)**  
- **Issue**: Incorrect event subscription and handling patterns
- **Impact**: No real-time updates, silent failures, broken communication with backend
- **Examples**: Wrong event names, missing event handlers, improper cleanup
