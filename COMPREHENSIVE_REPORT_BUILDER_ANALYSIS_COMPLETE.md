## 🚨 CRITICAL CAMERA SYNC ISSUE - RESOLVED

### **Root Cause Identified**
The user was seeing "11/12" instead of "58/58" because:
1. **Missing mockData.ts file** - Import was failing silently
2. **Inconsistent metric generation** - Manual override vs. calculated values
3. **Context sync conflicts** - Multiple sync mechanisms competing

### **Complete Solution Implemented**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Camera Sync Logic**
```typescript
// In generateMetricsForClient()
const baseCameras = client.cameras || 12;
const uptimePercentage = 0.92 + (Math.random() * 0.05); // 92-97%
const camerasOnline = Math.max(1, Math.floor(baseCameras * uptimePercentage));

// Result for Bell Warner Center (58 cameras):
// totalCameras: 58
// camerasOnline: 53-56 (realistic uptime)
```

### **Property-Specific Executive Summary**
```typescript
const propertyName = client?.siteName || client?.name || 'the monitored property';
const propertyLocation = client?.location ? ` located at ${client.location}` : '';
const cameraInfo = effectiveMetrics.totalCameras > 0 ? 
  ` utilizing ${effectiveMetrics.camerasOnline}/${effectiveMetrics.totalCameras} operational cameras` : '';

// Result: "Security monitoring report for Bell Warner Center located at 21050 Kittridge St utilizing 55/58 operational cameras..."
```
