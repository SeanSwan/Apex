## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **New Components Created**:

- **Operations App (`/app`)**: Open access placeholder (no auth required)
- **404 Handling**: Professional error pages for unknown routes

### **Backward Compatibility**:
- All existing client portal functionality preserved
- Same test credentials and data
- No breaking changes to backend APIs
