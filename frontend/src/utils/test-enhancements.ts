// Test Data: Sample Weekly Report for Bulk Import
export const sampleWeeklyReport = `Monday (6 / 9)
Remote camera surveillance commenced the week with diligent observation focused on the external parking areas situated near the leasing office, as well as the visible front-unit garages. Amenity areas, including the pool and playground, were monitored for any after-hours activity and appeared quiet and secure. The perimeter fencing was scanned for any potential breaches, with the property appearing secure from all visible angles. LPR data from the main entrance and exit points was routinely logged for security records.

Tuesday (6 / 10)
Live monitoring continued with focused attention on vehicle traffic at the main entrance and exit points, consistently utilizing LPR data for routine security logging and to identify any unusual or suspicious vehicle patterns. Common areas accessible to camera view remained orderly and without incident. Remote checks of the leasing office exterior and visible parking areas showed typical daily activity patterns throughout both the day and evening shifts.

Wednesday (6 / 11)
Mid-week camera sweeps included general observation of common pathways and resident access points within the system's field of view. Individual garage doors that were visible were noted as consistently closed after resident use. The external parking lot displayed typical vehicle movement with no anomalies. Monitoring did not reveal any policy violations or immediate security concerns that required intervention or further action.

Thursday (6 / 12)
Security cameras maintained diligent and uninterrupted oversight of all visible areas of the property. There was a continued review of access points and LPR data as part of standard operating procedures. The visible perimeters and less frequented public areas were regularly scanned for any signs of unauthorized presence. Parking areas within camera view were observed for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity, with none detected during routine monitoring cycles.

Friday (6 / 13)
Remote surveillance continued with standard operational awareness around property entry and exit points. LPR data was systematically logged as part of ongoing security protocols. Cameras monitored visible common areas and parking lots for orderly conduct and any unusual gatherings, with none noted during the surveillance period. The inherent limitations in viewing all individual unit garages were acknowledged in the monitoring strategy.

Saturday (6 / 14)
Vigilant camera monitoring persisted throughout the day and into the night. Amenity areas such as the pool and any visible BBQ spots were observed for adherence to established property rules and posted hours. Visible parking areas remained clear of unauthorized vehicles. The perimeter was regularly scanned for any signs of transient activity or attempts to breach fences, with the property appearing secure within the established camera coverage zones.

Sunday (6 / 15)
The week concluded with steady and consistent remote monitoring. Final camera sweeps of all common areas, visible parking lots, and perimeter fencing confirmed that all appeared secure and orderly. Resident activity observed was minimal and consistent with typical Sunday evening patterns. No new security incidents, maintenance emergencies requiring immediate attention, or unusual activities were logged as the reporting period closed for the week.

Summary: This was an uneventful week with no specific incidents reported. Continuous camera monitoring focused on visible parking areas, access points, and LPR data logging, while acknowledging the limited visibility of rear unit garages. The property remained secure within the scope of camera coverage.`;
