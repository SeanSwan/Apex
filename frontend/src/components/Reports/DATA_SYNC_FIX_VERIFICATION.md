🚨 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
================================================

✅ FIXED: Removed local dailyReports state from EnhancedReportBuilder.tsx
✅ FIXED: Removed local summaryNotes state from EnhancedReportBuilder.tsx  
✅ FIXED: Removed local signature state from EnhancedReportBuilder.tsx
✅ FIXED: Removed local contactEmail state from EnhancedReportBuilder.tsx

✅ FIXED: DailyReportsPanel now receives context data only
✅ FIXED: PreviewPanel reads from same context data
✅ FIXED: All handlers update context directly (single source of truth)

📊 NEW DATA FLOW (Fixed):
1. User enters data in DailyReportsPanel
2. onReportChange updates CONTEXT ONLY
3. Context persists data automatically
4. Preview reads from SAME context
5. ✅ Data sync works!

❌ OLD BROKEN DATA FLOW:
1. User enters data in DailyReportsPanel  
2. onReportChange updates LOCAL STATE
3. Preview reads from CONTEXT (different source)
4. ❌ Data sync fails!

🎯 TEST PLAN:
1. Enter data in Daily Reports tab
2. Switch to Preview tab
3. Verify data appears immediately
4. Refresh page - data should persist
5. Switch back to Daily Reports - data should be there

🔍 DEBUGGING LOGS TO WATCH:
- "📊 FIXED: Using context as single source of truth"
- "🚨 FIXED: Daily report update - CONTEXT ONLY"  
- "✅ FIXED: Daily report saved DIRECTLY to context"
- "🖼️ Preview: Daily reports content verified and ready for display"

💡 TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- EnhancedReportBuilder: Uses context.dailyReports (read-only reference)
- DailyReportsPanel: Receives context data as props
- handleReportChange: Updates context.setDailyReports only
- EnhancedPreviewPanel: Reads from context.dailyReports
- Single source of truth: ReportDataContext

🚀 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Data entered in Daily Reports appears in Preview
✅ Data persists after tab switches
✅ Data persists after page refresh
✅ No console errors about sync failures
✅ Event system works for real-time updates
