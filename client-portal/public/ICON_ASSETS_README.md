# APEX AI Client Portal - Icon Assets

## Missing Icon Files

The following icon files are referenced but missing. These should be created for production:

### Required PNG Icons:
- `favicon-16x16.png` - 16x16 pixel favicon
- `favicon-32x32.png` - 32x32 pixel favicon  
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixel iOS home screen icon
- `og-image.png` - Open Graph social media image (1200x630)

### Design Guidelines:
- Use APEX AI brand colors: Primary #1e40af, Accent #14b8a6
- Include stylized "A" logo with security shield elements
- Professional, clean design suitable for business use
- Ensure visibility at small sizes (16x16)

### Temporary Solution:
The `favicon.svg` file has been created as a scalable vector icon that browsers can use as a fallback.

### To Create PNG Icons:
1. Open the `favicon.svg` in a graphics editor (Figma, Sketch, Photoshop)
2. Export at the required sizes with proper optimization
3. Replace this file with the actual PNG assets

Note: The web manifest and HTML are configured to use these icons when available.
