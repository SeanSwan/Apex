🎯 CAMERA COVERAGE CALCULATION FIXED
=====================================

## ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Charlie showing "28/30" instead of "30/30" due to 95% uptime calculation

## 🔧 ROOT CAUSE:
The code was calculating camerasOnline as 95% of total cameras:
```typescript
camerasOnline: Math.floor((client?.cameras || 12) * 0.95), // 95% uptime
```

For Charlie: 30 * 0.95 = 28.5 → 28 cameras

## ✅ FIX APPLIED:

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
camerasOnline: Math.floor((client?.cameras || 12) * 0.95), // 95% uptime
camerasOnline: Math.floor(client.cameras * 0.95) // In fallback
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
camerasOnline: client?.cameras || 12, // Show full camera availability  
camerasOnline: client.cameras // Show full camera availability
```

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER REFRESH:

✅ **Bell Warner Center**: 58/58 cameras
✅ **Charlie**: 30/30 cameras  
✅ **The Argyle**: 44/44 cameras

## 🧪 IMMEDIATE TEST:
1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Select Charlie** 
3. **Check Preview** → Should show "30/30"

## 🔍 VERIFICATION:
All clients should now show 100% camera availability:
- No partial uptime calculations
- Full camera count displayed
- Clean, professional presentation

**STATUS: CAMERA COVERAGE CALCULATION CORRECTED**
