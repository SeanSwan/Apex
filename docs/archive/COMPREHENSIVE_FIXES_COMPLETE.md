üéØ COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE RESOLUTION COMPLETE
==================================================

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

- Added onclone function to remove loading elements from captured image
- Enhanced error handling and debugging
- Improved image quality with 0.95 compression

**Files Modified**:
- `DataVisualizationPanel.tsx` - Enhanced chart capture timing

### ISSUE 2: Daily Reports Data Flow ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Daily reports data not passing from editing to preview page
