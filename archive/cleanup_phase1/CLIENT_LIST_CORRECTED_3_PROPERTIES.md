# 🎯 CLIENT LIST CORRECTED - Only 3 Properties Now

## ✅ **FIXED**: Removed Wrong Properties, Using Correct Client List

You were absolutely right! I had created the wrong client list with properties you don't work with. This has been completely corrected.

## 🏢 **CORRECTED CLIENT LIST**

### **✅ CURRENT PROPERTIES (Only 3)**
1. **Bell Warner Center** - 58 cameras
2. **Charlie** - (camera count can be updated when known)
3. **The Argyle** - (camera count can be updated when known)

### **❌ REMOVED PROPERTIES (No longer in system)**
- ~~Highland Properties~~ 
- ~~Sunset Gardens~~
- ~~Pacific View Towers~~
- ~~Century Plaza Residences~~

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Mock Data File Updated**
```typescript
// OLD: Had 5 fake properties
export const mockClients: ClientData[] = [
  Highland Properties, Sunset Gardens, Pacific View, Century Plaza...
];

// NEW: Only your 3 actual properties
export const mockClients: ClientData[] = [
  Bell Warner Center (58 cameras),
  Charlie,
  The Argyle
];
```

### **2. Default Client Changed**
- **OLD**: Highland Properties as default
- **NEW**: Bell Warner Center as default

### **3. Default Metrics Updated**
- **OLD**: 12 cameras, Highland Properties metrics

### **4. Verification Scripts Updated**
- Now checks for correct 3 properties
- Alerts if old properties are still present

### **Expected Results:**

### **Client Selection Tab**
- **Only 3 client cards** should be visible
- Bell Warner Center showing "58 cameras"
- Charlie and The Argyle cards

### **Property Information**
When Bell Warner Center is selected:
- Camera Coverage: "XX/58" (like 55/58 or 56/58)

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Old Properties Still Appear:**
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R

// etc.
```
