📞 SUPPORT NOTES

If any integration issues arise:
1. Run the comprehensive test first: `python test_tier1_video_integration.py`
2. Check dependency requirements in each module
3. Verify OpenCV and ultralytics installations
4. Review log outputs for specific error details

The video capture system is designed to gracefully handle missing dependencies and provide informative error messages for troubleshooting.
