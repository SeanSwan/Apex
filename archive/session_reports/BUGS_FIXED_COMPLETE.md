# 🔧 APEX AI - QUICK BUG FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ BUGS SUCCESSFULLY FIXED

Your **Phase 2A-1: Multi-Monitor Coordination** system had 2 minor implementation bugs that have now been **completely resolved**:

### **🐛 BUG 1: Correlation Analysis Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'confidence_score'`
**Cause**: The correlation analysis was returning a dict instead of a proper correlation object
**Fix Applied**: Created a proper correlation calculation with structured return values

### **🐛 BUG 2: WebSocket Client Attribute Error** ✅ FIXED  
**Error**: `'EnhancedWebSocketClient' object has no attribute 'websocket'`
**Cause**: Missing attribute reference in the WebSocket client
**Fix Applied**: Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
